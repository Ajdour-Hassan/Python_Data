# Tuples and  Set

# A tuples is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable , allows duplicate numbers

# Create a tuple
fruits = ('apple' , 'mango' , 'strawberries' , 'mango')

#tuple with Constructor (they are the same )
fruits_1 = tuple(('apple' , 'mango' , 'strawberries' , 'mango'))

# tuples single value need (,)
fruit2 = ('hassan',)
print(fruit2, type(fruit2))

# Get value
#print(fruits[1])

# Value can't change in tuple (it's unchangeable)
#fruits[0] = 'strawberries'
#print(fruits[0])

#delete tuple
#del fruit2
